<p align="justify"><font size="5">The second generation of computer started in 1947 and it was till 1962. In 1951, the first commercial computer was introduced. This generation was much advanced than the first generation. People invented more than 100 programming language. That means people started to know how can they manupulate this wonder device. In this era of computer they also put operating system. That means people were about to enter in the era of computer. IBM (International Business Machine) started to produce and sell computer for commercial purpose.<br>From 1963 till now these time period is considered as modern age or the third generation of computer. Many remarkable changes has occurred in this golden era of computer. First of all IBM started to sell personal computer(PC). Because of this the mass people of this world got the chance to interact with this device. Then the programming language has been developed a lot for past 20 years. Apple, Microsoft , Linux these kind of operating systems brought us some variety and choices that we can use any of them according to our choices or the advantages that we can get from them.<br>The world is changing as well as the technology that we are using is changing. After some day we will enter into another era of computer. But the history of computer will always be there. A history of glory. A history to tell the coming generation that how our life has been changed by this computer.
