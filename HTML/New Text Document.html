<h6 align="center"><font size="8">A BRIEF HISTORY OF COMPUTER</font></h6>
<p align="justify"><font size="5">The word computer came from a Greek word called "compute". It means counter. Now a days the computer not only counts but also does a lot of works. The backbone of technology is depending on computer. Computer is an electronic device. Actually there are a lot of things inside a computer which maintains the overall performance of a computer. Now the question comes, how this wonder machine came among us. We will know about it shortly.<br>In 19th century an English mathematician Charles Babbage discovered an analytical machine. At that time it was not named as computer. It was just a simple analytical machine whose job was to calculate fast in a analytical way. But later on people realize that the degine of this analytical machine was the base of our today's computer. The first computer was made by Dr. Atanasoff and Berry. This first electronic digital computer was named according to the names. The name is Atanasoff Berry Computer or in short ABC. It was built in 1937. This computer is considered as the first computer of first generation computers.
<br>From 1937 upto 1946 this time period is considered as the first generation. It's weird but true that the weight of one of the first generation computer was about 30 ton and the they turned on that computer, the lights started to dim. For the computers of first generation, they had no operating system and they were not able to do two task simultaneously.</font></p>
